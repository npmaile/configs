This is the config files for my setup. Most of my stuff is minimally configured. If you want to run your life like I run mine, feel free to use it. 
note - most of the directories will appear empty because stuff lives in dot dirs you need to run ls -la or show hidden files for it

make sure to run git clone --recursive to get it to work properly
